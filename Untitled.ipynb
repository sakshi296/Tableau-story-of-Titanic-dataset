    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has different types of graphs. All the graphs shows different findings. It shows, How did the number as well as pecentage of survivors affected by age-groups? Which gender has more survival rate? and many more. All the findings in the graphic representation involves around the number of survivors. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Design\n",
    "\n",
    "I have used titanic datset for visualization. I have worked on Tableau and made interesting visualizations. While exploring data , I found that females had more survival rate than males. The second thing that I noticed was, people with age-group 16 to 30 had more survival rate than other age groups. According to the dataset I had, I decided to use bar charts to visualize those assumptions which would be displayed further down below. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "I considered using multiple charts(bar charts, pie-charts, stacked-charts etc.) to test if this is a good way to visualize and stress on important point. Here is the description of my all the designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Survival By gender** \n",
    "\n",
    "Chart type -> Bar Chart \n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason for choosing bar chart**\n",
    "\n",
    "I have used bar chart for this visualization because these charts are useful for displaying data that is classified into nominal or odinal categories. If you have comparative data that you would like to represent through a chart then a bar chart would be the best option. Therefore I have used bar charts for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I have used the total records and found the number of survivors according to gender. According to the graph, I have noticed that number of females survived were more as compared to males. As seen in the Titanic movie that females were given life-jackets first. Moreover this can be one reason that more number of females were saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Survival by Age - group**\n",
    " \n",
    "Chart type -> Stacked bar chart\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason for choosing stacked bar chart**\n",
    "\n",
    "I have used stacked bar chart for this visualization because they are great for showing the total because they visually aggregate all of the categories in a group. Stacking also indicates a part to whole relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I have divided ages in groups. I have made 5 age groups of sizes 0-15, 16-30, 31-45, 46-60 and 61+. Then I found the survival rate for all the people falling in the these age-groups. I noticed that 16-30 age grouped people had higher survival rate as compared to others. \n",
    "\n",
    "Extending the above graph, I have also found how did the age-group and gender affected the survival rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Survival rate for different embarkments**\n",
    "\n",
    "Chart type -> Pie chart\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason for choosing pie chart**\n",
    "\n",
    "I have used pie chart for this visualization because the data here (embarkments) is categorical therefore if we have categorical data then using a pie chart would work really well as each slice can represent a different category. Therefore I have used pie chart here.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it can be seen in the dataset, we have 3 embarkments site Southhampton,UK(S), Cherbourg,FR(C) and Queenstown,IRE(Q). According to this I found the survival rate for all these 3 embarkments. This can be seen more clearly in the visualizatin\n",
    "\n",
    "[here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/sakshi2577#!/vizhome/TitanicDatasetAnalysis/Story_final) is the link to my Titanic Datset Visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have found different relationships between variables and in which manner they affected the survival rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "I have collected the feedback from one person and tried to follow Udacity guidelines and here are the abridged responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feedback 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1. What do you notice in the visualization?\n",
    "\n",
    "The graphs were clear and easy to understand. While looking at the graphs I found that lot of females survived. The visualization is quite interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What questions do you have about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "While looking at the graphs I found that something was missing. We all know that relatives are very important for our lives. I wanted to know that how many people that have relatives were saved? Many other questions also arose in my mind like how did age-group affected the survival rate. But all these graphs were already present. \n",
    "\n",
    "I would like you to show the relationship between people and their relatives and how many of them were saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What relationships do you notice?\n",
    "\n",
    "I noticed many relationships like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Large number of females were saved\n",
    "* Third class people have lost more lives.\n",
    "* males of age-group 16-30 have lost many lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main takeaway was, that Even at those times higher class people were given more preference. I also noticed the biased nature towards women. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Is there something you donâ€™t understand in the graphic?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the one thing I didn't understand was one graph initially, about the survival rate for different embarkments. I don't know more deeply about the data, therefore the embarkments survival rate was not clear. But after looking at it for some time I understood. The choice of pie-chart for this was quite understandable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Would be happy to see more interesting graphs ahead.  :)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Story\n",
    "\n",
    "After taking the feedback I have made some changes. As asked in the feedback that relatives survival rate was missing. Therefore I have made another graph of survival rate for relatives. As asked in the feedback I tried to add everything such that it can become easier for the viewer to understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "For making this graph, first of all I found that how many people had relatives i.e members present in a family. As given in the dataset we have measures for Parent-Children and Sibling-Spouse. From this information I made another field named \"Have relatives\" where I calculated total of Parent-Children and Sibling-Spouse. And after doing the calculation I plotted the graph between percentage of total(Sum of records) and relatives. I have used bar charts for this because it is easy for making comparisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting graph indicates 2 coulums, one that have relatives and other that do not have relatives. And finally we can see the percentage of people survived in each column. \n",
